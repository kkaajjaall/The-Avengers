With an amazing list of credits to his name, he has managed to stay new and fresh even after over four decades in the business. </p>\r\n                <p> Downey was born April 4, 1965 in Manhattan, New York, the son of writer, director and filmographer Robert Downey Sr. and actress Elsie Downey (nÃ©e Elsie Ann Ford). Robert's father is of half Lithuanian Jewish, one quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one quarter Irish, descent, while Robert's mother was of English, Scottish, German, and Swiss-German ancestry. Robert and his sister, Allyson Downey, were immersed in film and the performing arts from a very young age, leading Downey Jr. to study at the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York, before moving to California with his father following his parents' 1978 divorce. In 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High School to pursue acting full time. Downey Sr., himself a drug addict, exposed his son to drugs at a very early age, and Downey Jr. would go on to struggle with abuse for decades.   </p>\r\n               <p>  Downey Jr. made his debut as an actor at the age of five in the film Pound (1970), written and directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr.. He built his film repertoire throughout the 1980s and 1990s with roles in Tuff Turf (1985), Weird Science (1985), True Believer (1989), and Wonder Boys (2000) among many others. In 1992, Downey received an Academy Award nomination and won the BAFTA (British Academy Award) for Best Actor for his performance in the title role of Chaplin (1992). </p>\r\n               <p>  It's all about not getting your own way and that's what we try to instill in each other in ourselves with how do you become less encumber so you be in service to this fantastic medium that we get a chance in doing there's people throughout time who have been notorious and I get to be one of them to say it got in the way would be to say what I was \"expressing\" didn't have the validity for the suffering I chose to put myself through if it's all for nothing then it's a tragedy then if you put it down and move on its a way to demonstrate that when something occurs there's really nothing that anybody can do but survive as long as they survive</p>\r\n               \r\n              \r\n        </div>   \r\n            \r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default char1\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nconst char2 = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n            <div class=\"char2\">\r\n              <img  className=\"char-pic\"src=\"./images/c2.jpg\"/>\r\n              <div class=\"info\">\r\n              <h1> Chris Evans </h1>\r\n              <p>  Actor | </p>\r\n              <h3> as Steve Rogers </h3>\r\n              <p>   <strong> Born:</strong> June 13, 1981 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA </p>\r\n               <p>  <strong> Birth Name:</strong> \tChristopher Robert Evans </p>\r\n                 <p> <strong> Nickname:</strong> \tCevans </p>\r\n                 <p> <strong> Height: </strong> \t6' (1.83 m)</p>\r\n                 </div>\r\n                 </div> \r\n                 <div class=\"pass\">\r\n                <p> Christopher Robert Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre. </p>\r\n               <p> He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative Mike Capuano. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister, Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother named Scott Evans, who is also an actor, and a sister named Shana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. </p>\r\n               <p> On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on The Fugitive (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in Cherry Falls (2000) and The Newcomers (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in Boston Public (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, Not Another Teen Movie (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.</p>\r\n               <p>  The year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance. The Nanny Diaries (2007), where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie Street Kings (2008), playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond (2008).</p>\r\n             \r\n        </div>   \r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default char2\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nconst char3 = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n        \r\n        <div class=\"char2\">\r\n              <img  className=\"char-pic\"src=\"./images/c3.jpg\"/>\r\n              <div class=\"info\">\r\n              <h1> Scarlett Johansson</h1>\r\n              <p>  Actress | Producer | Director</p>\r\n              <h3> as Natasha Romanoff</h3>\r\n              <p>   <strong> Born:</strong> November 22, 1984 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA</p>\r\n               <p>  <strong> Birth Name:</strong> \t\tScarlett Ingrid Johansson </p>\r\n                 <p> <strong> Nickname:</strong>  </p>\r\n                 <p> <strong> Height: </strong>  5' 3\" (1.6 m)</p>\r\n                 </div>\r\n                 </div> \r\n                 <div class=\"pass\">\r\n                <p>  Scarlett Ingrid Johansson was born on November 22, 1984 in Manhattan, New York City, New York.

After a tumultuous yet happy childhood with his four younger siblings, Renner graduated from Beyer High School and attended Modesto Junior College. He explored several areas of study, including computer science, criminology, and psychology, before the theater department, with its freedom of emotional expression, drew him in. </p>\r\n               <p> However, Renner recognized the potential in acting as much through the local police academy as through drama classes. During his second year at Modesto Junior College, Renner role-played a domestic disturbance perpetrator as part of a police-training exercise for an easy $50. Deciding to shift his focus away from schoolwork, Renner left college and moved to San Francisco to study at the American Conservatory Theater. From there he moved to Hawaii and, in 1993, to Los Angeles.</p>\r\n               <p>  In Los Angeles, Renner devoted himself to theater, most notably starring in and co-directing the critically acclaimed \"Search and Destroy.\" He pursued other projects during this time as well, landing his first film role in 1995's National Lampoon's Senior Trip (1995). After several commercials and supporting roles in television movies and series, Renner captured the attention of critics with his gripping, complex portrayal of the infamous serial killer in the 2002 film Dahmer (2002). Renner's performance, which earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination, is especially remarkable for painting a humane and sympathetic, yet deeply disturbing, portrait of the title character.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Renner took a break from small indie films to work on his first commercially successful movie, S.W.A.T. (2003), with Colin Farrell. In 2005, he played the leading role in Neo Ned (2005) as an institutionalized white supremacist in love with a black girl, winning the Palm Beach International Film Festival's best actor award. Renner's pivotal supporting roles in 2005's 12 and Holding (2005) and North Country (2005) earned him accolades from critics, and his 2007 turn in Take (2007) garnered him the best actor award at California's Independent Film Festival. Also in 2007, Renner played a leading role in the horror film 28 Weeks Later (2007) as well as a supporting role in the underrated Western epic The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), with Casey Affleck, Brad Pitt, and Sam Rockwell.</p>\r\n\r\n        </div>   \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default char4\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nconst char5 = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n            <div class=\"char2\">\r\n              <img  className=\"char-pic\"src=\"./images/c5.jpg\"/>\r\n              <div class=\"info\">\r\n              <h1> Mark Ruffalo</h1>\r\n              <p>  Actor | Producer </p>\r\n              <h3> as Bruce Banner</h3>\r\n              <p> <strong> Born:</strong> \tNovember 22, 1967 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, USA</p>\r\n               <p>  <strong> Birth Name:</strong>  \tMark Alan Ruffalo</p>\r\n                 \r\n                 <p> <strong> Height: </strong> \t5' 8Â½\" (1.74 m)</p>\r\n                 </div>\r\n                 </div> \r\n                 <div class=\"pass\">\r\n                     <p> Award-winning actor Mark Ruffalo was born on November 22, 1967, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, of humble means to father Frank Lawrence Ruffalo, a construction painter and Marie Rose (Hebert), a stylist and hairdresser; his father's ancestry is Italian and his mother is of half French-Canadian and half Italian descent. Mark moved with his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he lived out most of his teenage years. Following high school, Mark moved with his family to San Diego and soon migrated north, eventually settling in Los Angeles.</p>\r\n                     <p> Mark first took classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory and subsequently co-founded the Orpheus Theatre Company, an Equity-Waiver establishment, where he worked in nearly every capacity. From acting, writing, directing and producing to running the lights and building sets while building his resume.\r\n\r\nMoving into film and TV, Mark's inauspicious movie debut was the drifter role of Christian in the horror opus Mirror Mirror 2: Raven Dance (1994) and returned to the film series in the role of Joey with Mirror Mirror 3: The Voyeur (1995). He continued on through the 1990's rather indistinctly with more secondary roles in the horror film The Dentist (1996) starring madman Corbin Bernsen; an amusing perf in the obscure dramedy The Last Big Thing (1996); a third billed role in the Jerry Stiller/Anne Meara bickering senior comedy A Fish in the Bathtub (1998); and the war drama Ceremony... the Ritual of Love (1976) directed by Ang Lee.\r\n</p>\r\n<p> Bartending for nearly nearly a decade to make ends meet and discouraged enough to give it up, a chance meeting and resulting collaboration with playwright/screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan approaching the millennium changed everything. Ruffalo won NY success in Lonergan's 1996 off-Broadway play \"This Is Our Youth,\" a story about troubled young adults. This led to his male lead in Lonergan's Oscar-winning film drama You Can Count on Me (2000), playing the ne'er-do-well brother of Laura Linney. The performance drew rave reviews and invited comparisons to an early Marlon Brando.\r\n\r\nRuffalo never looked back. Notable roles in The Last Castle (2001), XX/XY (2002), and Windtalkers (2002) followed, although in 2002 Ruffalo was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, a type of brain tumor. Though the tumor was benign, the resulting surgery led to a period of partial facial paralysis, from which he fully recovered. In 2003, Ruffalo scored leading roles alongside two popular female stars, playing a police detective opposite Meg Ryan in In the Cut (2003) and the love interest of Gwyneth Paltrow in the comedy View from the Top (2003). </p>\r\n                \r\n              </div>   \r\n        \r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default char5\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nconst char6 = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n        <div class=\"char2\">\r\n              <img  className=\"char-pic\"src=\"./images/c6.jpg\"/>\r\n              <div class=\"info\">\r\n              <h1> Chris Hemsworth</h1>\r\n              <p>  Actor | Producer | Soundtrack </p>\r\n              <h3>  as Thor</h3>\r\n              <p> <strong> Born:</strong> \tAugust 11, 1983 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</p>\r\n               <p>  <strong> Birth Name:</strong>Christopher Hemsworth</p>\r\n                 \r\n                 <p> <strong> Height: </strong> \t6' 2Â¾\" (1.9 m)</p>\r\n                 </div>\r\n                 </div> \r\n                 <div class=\"pass\">\r\n                     <p> Christopher Hemsworth was born on August 11, 1983 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia to Leonie Hemsworth (nÃ©e van Os), an English teacher & Craig Hemsworth, a social-services counselor.
